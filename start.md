To keep things simple and maintain motivation, it's best to start with the most basic, core functionality of your game. Let's focus on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) that you can build upon. Here's what I'd suggest as your starting point:



1. Basic Game Loop and Player Input

Start by creating a simple game loop that:
1. Displays the current game state (initially just a welcome message)
2. Accepts player input
3. Processes that input
4. Updates the game state
5. Repeats

Here's a basic structure to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to Dark Woods!")
	
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	
	for {
		fmt.Print("> ")
		input, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
		input = strings.TrimSpace(input)
		
		if input == "quit" {
			break
		}
		
		// Process the input
		processCommand(input)
	}
	
	fmt.Println("Thanks for playing Dark Woods!")
}

func processCommand(command string) {
	switch command {
	case "look":
		fmt.Println("You are in a dark forest. Trees loom all around you.")
	case "north", "south", "east", "west":
		fmt.Printf("You move %s.\n", command)
	default:
		fmt.Println("I don't understand that command.")
	}
}
```

This gives you a basic framework to:
1. Start the game
2. Accept commands
3. Process simple commands
4. Quit the game

From here, you can gradually add more features:

1. Implement a basic map system with a few locations
2. Add a player struct to keep track of the player's position
3. Implement more complex movement between map locations
4. Add simple items that the player can pick up and use
5. Create basic puzzles or obstacles

By starting small and adding features incrementally, you'll maintain a working game at each step, which can help keep you motivated. Each new feature you add will make the game more engaging and complex.

Remember, the key is to keep it simple at first and build up gradually. This approach allows you to see progress quickly and helps maintain motivation as you develop your skills in Go programming.

Would you like me to provide a more detailed example of any of these initial steps?
