You're on the right track with your initial visual mapping of the game elements. To build this properly and create a solid foundation for your Go CLI game, follow these steps:

1. Define Core Structures:
   Start by defining the main structures of your game. Based on your diagram, these include:

   - Player
   - Room
   - Item
   - Map
   - Enemy

   For each structure, list out its attributes and methods. For example:

   ```go
   type Player struct {
       Name      string
       Health    int
       Inventory []Item
       Location  *Room
   }

   type Room struct {
       Name  string
       Items []Item
       Exits map[string]*Room
   }
   ```

2. Establish Relationships:
   Define how these structures relate to each other. For instance:
   - A Player is always in a Room (Location field in Player struct)
   - A Room can contain multiple Items
   - The Map is composed of interconnected Rooms

3. Design Interfaces:
   Create interfaces for common behaviors. This will make your code more flexible and testable. For example:

   ```go
   type Interactable interface {
       Interact(p *Player)
   }
   ```

   Both Item and Enemy could implement this interface.

4. Plan Game Loop:
   Outline the main game loop, which typically involves:
   - Displaying the current room description
   - Getting player input
   - Processing the input (moving, interacting with items, etc.)
   - Updating game state
   - Checking for game end conditions

5. State Management:
   Decide how you'll manage game state. Will you use a central Game struct that holds all the information, or will you distribute state across different components?

6. User Interface:
   Plan your CLI interface. How will you present information to the player and receive input?

7. Error Handling:
   Plan for robust error handling to manage invalid inputs or unexpected game states.

8. Testing Strategy:
   Outline how you'll test each component of your game. Go's testing package makes it easy to write unit tests for your game logic.

Here's a more detailed example of how you might structure some of your code:

```go
type Game struct {
    Player *Player
    Map    *Map
}

type Map struct {
    Rooms []*Room
}

type Player struct {
    Name      string
    Health    int
    Inventory []Item
    Location  *Room
}

type Room struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
    Items       []Item
    Exits       map[string]*Room
    Enemies     []*Enemy
}

type Item struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
}

type Enemy struct {
    Name   string
    Health int
}

func (g *Game) Start() {
    // Initialize game
    // Start main game loop
}

func (g *Game) ProcessInput(input string) {
    // Handle player input
}

func (p *Player) Move(direction string) error {
    // Move player to a new room
}

func (r *Room) AddItem(item Item) {
    // Add an item to the room
}
```

Remember, this is a starting point. As you develop your game, you'll likely refine and expand these structures and relationships. The key is to start with a clear, modular design that allows for easy expansion and modification as your game grows in complexity.
